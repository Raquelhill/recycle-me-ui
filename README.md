# Recycle Me
Because sometimes we need a little help recycling.
Bin less, recycle more.

## Abstract
Recycle me is a web application built for the environmentally conscious person who would like to know more about recycling.  When the user visits the app, they are greeted by a map, search bar, and an instructional list of items that can be recycled in the recycle bin at home.  The user can enter their address or zip code, as well as a hard to recycle item (which autofills while the user is typing) into the search bar.  When the user presses the search key, the ten closest recycle drop-off locations for that hard to reycle item will render on the map.  The user can click on a specific map marker to see the business name, address, phone number, and a link to the companies external website.
