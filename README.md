<h1> ♻ Recycle Me 	♻️</h1>
<p>Because sometimes we need a little help recycling.
Bin less, recycle more.</p>
<p>Recycle me is a web application built for the environmentally conscious person who would like to know more about recycling.  When the user visits the app, they are greeted by a map, search bar, and an instructional list of items that can be recycled in the recycle bin at home.  The user can enter their address or zip code, as well as a hard to recycle item (which autofills while the user is typing) into the search bar.  When the user presses the search key, the ten closest recycle drop-off locations for that hard to reycle item will render on the map.  The user can click on a specific map marker to see the business name, address, phone number, and a link to the companies external website.</p>

## Planning
- App development [planned and tracked]() using GitHub Projects
- [Wireframe]() created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Wins
``Learning new technologies -- Apollo, GraphQL, and Google Maps!``

- Independently learning each technology through documentation, YouTube tutorials, the help of Project Manger's and team collaboration was a rewarding experience.   

## Challenges and Improvements
``Map``

- Learning and implementing a map with markers in a 14 day sprint was challenging.  We began with MapBox, but pivoted to Google Maps mid-project.  

## Future Iterations
  - A map that shows international recycling locations.
  - A quiz to test the users knowledge about which items can and cannot be recycled.
